# Background on our team

Our team develops and applies environmental models, primarily focused on surface water modeling and water quality. We have three main areas we think would benefit significantly from quantum computing in the future:
 
1. Our high fidelity water quality models have significant computational fluid dynamics (CFD) components that limit the time scales and accuracy of our simulations.
2. There is a long-term need for high fidelity modeling and water mapping for improved military readiness and operations around the world in data-poor regions under non-stationary climate-driven conditions. 
3. We are increasingly working with machine learning to advance our modeling and analysis capabilities for adaptive ecosystem management and military installation vulnerability assessments, particularly under changing climate change conditions. This work will involve significant quantities of data and computationally intensive tools, e.g., long-term Monte Carlo simulations.
 
We are interested in learning how our tools need to be adapted to take advantage of quantum computing hardware, understanding the trade-offs and limitations, and identifying current modeling gaps that may be improved with future improvements in quantum computing systems.
